In this repository, for the assignment we included source code, data and a report using codelabs while implementing the following:

* Created Warehouse, Database in Snowflake and deployed the application on Studio Labs

* Build a streamlit app to get insights from ML forecast

* Performed hands on Snowflake lab on weather nyc dataset to predict the number of trips started from a given station each day. We create a citibike forecast application in which we can select time range and stations, and it will predict the number of trips started from a given station and also explains which features of the model were most used while making predictions.
